**space_Veins** is an extension of [Veins](https://veins.car2x.org) which integrates satellites as additional communication partners in vehicular networks.
By using Veins, the discrete event simulator [OMNeT++](https://omnetpp.org) and the road traffic simulator [SUMO](https://www.eclipse.org/sumo) are used in order to simulate vehicular networks.
In addition, space_Veins provides OMNeT++ modules for modeling satellites.
The satellites' mobility is based on the [SGP4 model](https://celestrak.com/publications/AIAA/2006-6753/) which can calculate orbits of satellites based on NASA/NORAD [Two-Line Element sets](https://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/).
