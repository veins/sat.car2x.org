## space_Veins 0.2
space_Veins 0.2 is online. Changes:
* The satellite mobility model is still based on the SGP4 model but now it is purely written in C/C++ code.
* Skyfield and all required dependencies are removed.
* Some bug fixes.

## space_Veins 0.1
space_Veins 0.1 is released and ready to download from its github repository. Since it depends on Veins 5.1, space_Veins requires all dependencies of Veins 5.1, like SUMO and OMNeT++, too.
