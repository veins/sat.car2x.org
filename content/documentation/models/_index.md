space_Veins makes use of different models for different purposes.
There are dedicated models for different types of mobilities or for different types of communication.
Most of them are provided by dependencies like [INET], [SUMO], or [Veins].
This page tries to give an overview of them and links to a place with more detailed information.

Currently, only the following parts of space_Veins are documented, since space_Veins is still in the early stages of development:
- [Mobility](/documentation/models/mobility)
