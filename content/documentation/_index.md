**space_Veins** provides satellite models for OMNeT++ which consider satellites' mobility as well as Vehicle-to-Satellite communication.
Currently, only the following parts of space_Veins are documented since space_Veins is still in the early stages of development:
- [Installation](/documentation/installation)
- [Running the example](/documentation/example)

In the future, a detailed documentation regarding the following aspects can be found here:
- Simulation architecture
- Abstractions/models used
- Satellites' mobility
- Vehicle-to-Satellite communication stack
